        <h1>Support & FAQ</h1>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does Are You Dead? work?</h3>
            <p>Set a check-in interval (1-7 days) and add your emergency contacts. Before each deadline, tap "I'm OK" to check in. If you miss a check-in, your emergency contacts automatically receive SMS and email alerts letting them know to check on you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if I miss a check-in?</h3>
            <p>After your check-in deadline passes, our system waits 5 minutes then sends an alert to all your emergency contacts via SMS and email. The alert includes your name and a message asking them to check on you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I add emergency contacts?</h3>
            <p>Go to the Contacts tab in the app, tap "Add Contact", and enter their name, phone number, and/or email address. We recommend adding at least 2 contacts for redundancy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I change my check-in interval?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Go to Settings and adjust the "Check-In Interval" slider. You can set it anywhere from 1 to 7 days. Your new interval takes effect after your next check-in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if I'm going on vacation?</h3>
            <p>You can increase your check-in interval to 7 days in Settings before you leave. You can also add a note in the app (coming soon) to remind yourself when you changed it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why did my contact receive a false alert?</h3>
            <p>This can happen if you forget to check in before your deadline. To prevent false alerts, enable push notifications so you receive reminders at 24h, 6h, and 1h before your deadline. You can also increase your check-in interval if the current one is too frequent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>My contact didn't receive their alert. What happened?</h3>
            <p>Check the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify the phone number and email address are correct</li>
                <li>Ask them to check their spam/junk folder</li>
                <li>SMS delivery can be affected by carrier issues</li>
                <li>Some phone numbers may be blocked by carriers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If problems persist, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@areyoudead.site">support@areyoudead.site</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I enable push notifications?</h3>
            <p>When you first open the app, you'll be asked to enable notifications. If you declined, you can enable them in your device settings: Settings > Are You Dead? > Notifications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We do not track your location or sell your data. We only collect what's necessary to operate the service: your email, optional phone number, emergency contact info, and check-in timestamps. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
            <p>Go to Settings > Delete Account. This will permanently delete your account and all associated data including check-in history and emergency contacts. This action cannot be undone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does this replace calling 911?</h3>
            <p><strong>No.</strong> Are You Dead? is not a medical device or emergency service. It is designed to alert trusted contacts if you don't check in. In case of emergency, always call 911 (or your local emergency number) directly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How can I get a refund?</h3>
            <p>Refunds are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store where you purchased the app. Visit their support pages to request a refund according to their policies.</p>
